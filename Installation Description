Development Setup

1. Installing Node.js
Check if you have already installed and the version using the following command

node -v
make sure it is v0.12 or greater, or install/update your node run the command

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
2. Yeoman Generator
This guy will help us scaffold a lot of code

sudo npm install -g yo
yeoman supports generator for different kinds of project. we have to install those
generators separately you can find more of them at yeoman
for our session we will be using generator-angular. install it using

sudo npm install -g generator-angular
3. Create first project
using the above generator and the yo tool we can generate a sample angular app. which we can build on.

mkdir todo
cd todo
yo angular todo
Would you like to use Sass (with Compass)? No
Would you like to include Bootstrap? Yes
Enter on the module selection page
above command will create a basic project inside the todo directory. This has only project specific code.

4. Installing dependencies
now we should download all the dependent libraries
run the following command for that

npm install bower grunt grunt-cli

npm install

bower install
WARNING: if you get EACCESS Error in any of the above command try running them with sudo
5. Running the project
Now our code base is setup. This project include following things

Grunt - task runner
Bower - client dependancy manager
NPM - Node packaga manange
Karma - Test Runner

To view our project we need a server. Grunt got a task which will create a web server and host our code so that we can view our projects. It also comes with a watch/live reload so whenever you make change to your files they will automatically updated.
grunt serve
It will open up a browser http://localhost:9000 and you can see your project
